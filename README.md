## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system before proceeding:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Maven
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/selimlendiniz/SpringBoot-MicroServices-Demo.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Build and package each component with Maven:

### Endpoints
#### Student Microservice
- POST http://localhost:8222/api/v1/schools
- {
 "name":"School name",
 "email":"Rosa16@yahoo.com"
 }


- POST http://localhost:8222/api/v1/students
- {
  "firstName":"Hillary",
  "lastName":"Kris",
  "email":"Raegan40@hotmail.com",
  "schoolId":1
  }


- GET http://localhost:8222/api/v1/schools/with-students/{schoolId}

## Project Components

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, managing and routing them to the appropriate microservices.

### Config Server

The Config Server centralizes configuration management for all microservices, simplifying application maintenance and consistency across environments.

### Discovery Server

The Discovery Server provides service registration and discovery, enabling seamless service-to-service communication within the microservices ecosystem.

### Student Microservice

The Student Microservice is responsible for managing student-related data and operations, such as adding, updating, and retrieving student records.

### School Microservice

The School Microservice manages school-related data and operations, including adding, updating, and retrieving school records.

## Inter-Service Communication

### Using OpenFeign

This project demonstrates inter-service communication using OpenFeign, a declarative REST client that simplifies service-to-service communication within the microservices ecosystem.

## Distributed Tracing

### Using Zipkin

The project showcases the use of Zipkin for distributed tracing, enhancing application observability and enabling the visualization and troubleshooting of latency issues.
